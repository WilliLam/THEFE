	<p>Here are some tips to reduce our food waste:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Shop smart: make plans and grocery list so we canbuy exactly what we need and avoid impulse buys.</li>
			<li>First in, First out: when unpacking groceries, move older products to the front and put new products to the back </li>
			<li>Store and eat leftovers: try storing food in airtight containers and keep for next lunch</li>
			<li>Donate anything!: anything from canned food to food scraps can be donated. Edible food can be given to the hungries and farmers would ahppily accept the food scraps for fertilisers</li>
