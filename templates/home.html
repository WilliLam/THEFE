<p>35% of Hong Kongâ€™s  wastes were composed of food waste, and is the largest component of solid waste in the landfills. The amount of food waste produced globally annually is more than enough to feed most hungry people in the world. Cutting down on food waste can easily keep people away from hunger and also reduce the amount of waste in our landfills. Simple actions can help reduce waste produced daily, such as shopping smart and donating food. We should get use of a habit of not wasting food, because there are lots of people who are starving.
